# week-8-project

I created a full-stack website for the Brilliance of Being. I used HTML JS CSS and NODE.JS to build this out. 
I have been so grateful for the opportunity to solidify a lot of the skills that I've learned over the past several weeks!

My 3 Features include: 
- A JS carousel for scrolling through a series of photos on the page. 
-A server that saves email addresses for the newsletter.
-A place for people to send messages that will be sent to the database for us to view and reach out to them in the participate section. 

I created img tags for all of the photos and initially had them saved in a separate JS file for ease of use. After I built out my JS
function I was able to insert them all into one div so they would all scroll horizontally using flex in CSS. I also +1820 pixels to 
either side when the arrows are clicked, so that it looks like a smooth transition from one set of pictures to the next.
I created a server with server.js and a controller file as well to keep things neat. I was able to build out a database to store 
the emails and any messages that were sent as well. I had a great time creating this, thank you for all the help along the way
so that this could be made possible!
